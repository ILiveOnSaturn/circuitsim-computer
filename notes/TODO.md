okay so i think that the alu needs to do every and all operations that do not include registers (like rotate and increment and such) so for now
- [x] implement all 16 operations in the [alu wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit)
	- [x] add a register for the flags
- [ ] map alu operations and create register component that will interface with all registers
- [x] make flipflop without pulse so bus register will be able to pulse **ONLY** when clocks goes high
