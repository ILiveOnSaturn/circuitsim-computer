okay so i think that the alu needs to do every and all operations that do not include registers (like rotate and increment and such) so for now
- [ ] implement all 16 operations in the [alu wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit)
	- [ ] add a register for the flags

# Circuitjs
- [ ] implement alu in transistors logic
